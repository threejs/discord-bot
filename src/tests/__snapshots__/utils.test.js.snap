Whenever you create an instance of a *three.js* type, you allocate a certain amount of memory. However, *three.js* creates for specific objects like geometries or materials WebGL related entities like buffers or shader programs which are necessary for rendering. It's important to highlight that these objects are not released automatically. Instead, the application has to use a special API in order to free such resources. This guide provides a brief overview about how this API is used and what objects are relevant in this context.",

Sometimes, however, you want to apply one or more graphical effects like Depth-Of-Field, Bloom, Film Grain or various types of Anti-aliasing. Post-processing is a widely used approach to implement such effects. First, the scene is rendered to a render target which represents a buffer in the video card's memory. In the next step one or more post-processing passes apply filters and effects to the image buffer before it is eventually rendered to the screen.",

The weight and time scales of different simultaneous animations on the same object as well as on different objects can be changed independently. Various animations on the same and on different objects can be synchronized.
 To achieve all this in one homogeneous system, the three.js animation system [has completely changed in 2015](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/6881) (beware of outdated information!), and it has now an architecture similar to Unity/Unreal Engine 4.

    "description": "A standard physically based material, using Metallic-Roughness workflow.
 Physically based rendering (PBR) has recently become the standard in many 3D applications, such as [Unity](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2014/10/29/physically-based-shading-in-unity-5-a-primer/), [Unreal](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/Materials/PhysicallyBased/) and [3D Studio Max](http://area.autodesk.com/blogs/the-3ds-max-blog/what039s-new-for-rendering-in-3ds-max-2017).
 This approach differs from older approaches in that instead of using approximations for the way in which light interacts with a surface, a physically correct model is used. The idea is that, instead of tweaking materials to look good under specific lighting, a material can be created that will react 'correctly' under all lighting scenarios.
 In practice this gives a more accurate and realistic looking result than the MeshLambertMaterial or MeshPhongMaterial, at the cost of being somewhat more computationally expensive.
 Shading is calculated in the same way as for the MeshPhongMaterial, using a [Phong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phong_shading) shading model. This calculates shading per pixel (i.e. in the [fragment shader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader#Pixel_shaders), AKA pixel shader) which gives more accurate results than the Gouraud model used by MeshLambertMaterial, at the cost of some performance.
 Note that for best results you should always specify an environment map when using this material.
